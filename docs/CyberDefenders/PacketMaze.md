## Q2. What is the IPv6 address of the DNS server used by 192.168.1.26? (####::####:####:####:####)
We can filter the DNS packets using the following filter:
```
dns
```
On analyzing the packet, we can see the source MAC address.

![packetmaze 2](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/a5512a90-60b6-49bb-84af-f79ebf08d208)

We can create a second filter as follows:
```
eth.src == c8:09:a8:57:47:93 && ipv6 && dns
```
Let's look at the first packet.

## Q6. What was the camera model name used to take picture 20210429_152157.jpg ?
Since the image is a file, we can filter out for FTP-Data.
```
ftp-data
```

![packetmaze 6](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/1160632f-ff86-4a16-912e-83910c89bdf1)

We can see the file being moved. On following the TCP stream we can see the contents of the file.

![packetmaze 6 2](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/440354a4-db9d-4ffa-84a9-5e09d20da587)

There's the camera model name. However there is a better way to do this.

Let's save the image in `Raw` format.

![packetmaze 6 3](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/048cb4cd-f98a-4014-b336-db27d18d844e)

Using `exiftool` we can view the metadata of the image.
```
$ exiftool 20210429_152157.jpg 
--snip--;
Camera Model Name               : LM-Q725K
--snip--;
```

### Answer
```
LM-Q725K

## Q7. What is the server certificate public key that was used in TLS session: da4a0000342e4b73459d7360b4bea971cc303ac18d29b99067e46d16cc07f4ff?
We can filter the packet based on the session ID the we have been provided with.
```
tls.handshake.session_id == da:4a:00:00:34:2e:4b:73:45:9d:73:60:b4:be:a9:71:cc:30:3a:c1:8d:29:b9:90:67:e4:6d:16:cc:07:f4:ff
```
In the `Server key Exchange` field we can find the `Pubkey`.

frame contains protonmail.com && tls
```
Let's look at the first packet. In the `Random` field we can find the answer to our question.

## Q9. What country is the MAC address of the FTP server registered in? (two words, one space in between)
On filtering for `ftp` traffic, we can find the source MAC address.

![packetmaze 9 3](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/c757841e-332c-459a-8a79-8fbfdc5abc13)

We can then search this MAC address on DNSChecker.

## Q10. What time was a non-standard folder created on the FTP server on the 20th of April? (hh:mm)
We need to first filter for FTP-Data.
```
ftp-data
```
On following the TCP stream, we can see a list of folders.

![packetmaze 10](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/f9146d1e-2b09-4564-b033-f7971f78c0ab)

Out of all the folders in the list the `ftp` folder is the non-standard one.

### Answer
```

## Q11. What domain was the user connected to in packet 27300?
We have to first set a filter.
```
frame.number == 27300
```
We can see the destination address of the packet.

![packetmaze 11](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/1aa0083d-d78b-4f62-809f-6b450ce817aa)

Now let's go to `Statistics > Resolved Addresses` in order to see if this IP address has been resolved or not.
