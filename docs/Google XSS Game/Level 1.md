> 1. To see the source of the application you can right-click on the frame and choose _View Frame Source_ from the context menu or use your browser's developer tools to inspect network traffic.

> 2. What happens when you enter a presentational tag such as `<h1>`?

> 3. Alright, one last hint: `<script> ... alert ...`
