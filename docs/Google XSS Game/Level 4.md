## Hints

> 1. Take a look at how the `startTimer` function is called.

> 2. When browsers parse tag attributes, they HTML-decode their values first. `<foo bar='z'>` is the same as `<foo bar='&#x7a;'`

> 3. Try entering a single quote (') and watch the error console.

## Exploitation

### Payload

We can provide the following payload to solve this problem:

```

```
