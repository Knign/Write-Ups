tcpdump

# Question 4
> What file extension did the attacker use to bypass the file upload filter implemented by the developer?
- The attacker tried to delete a file named `x.phtml`.
![[4 3.png]]
- The PHTML files contain PHP code that is parsed by a PHP engine which allows the web server to generate dynamic HTML that is displayed in a web browser.
## Answer
```
.phtml
```
# Question 5
> Based on the commands run by the attacker before removing the php shell, what misconfiguration was exploited in the ‘python’ binary to gain root-level access? 1- Reverse Shell ; 2- File Upload ; 3- File Write ; 4- SUID ; 5- Library load
- We can see that the attacker tried to find binaries with the SUID bit set.
![[5 3.png]]
- On executing a binary with the SUID bit set, the file executes with the effective permissions of the owner of the file instead of the person executing. This allows for temporary privilege escalation.
- Then the attacker executes `sh`.
