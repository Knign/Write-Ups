## What is the email service used by the malicious actor?
To find the email service used by the malicious actor we need to check the `Received` field after opening the email in a text-editor.

## What is the Reply-To email address?
If we open the file using Thunderbird, we can find the `Reply-To` email address.

### Answer

## What is the filetype of the received attachment which helped to continue the investigation?
Let's open the PDF file attached to the email.

![3](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/e91adc52-a32a-4956-adcb-178fb43f9aef)

So the file isn't opening. Maybe it is not really a PDF.

Using the `file` utility we can check the actual format of the file.
```
$ file PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf 
PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
```
### Answer
```
zip
```

&nbsp;

## What is the name of the malicious actor?
Now that we know it is a ZIP file, we can rename it to `PuzzleToCoCanDa.zip` and then unzip it.
```
$ unzip PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf
Archive:  PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf
  inflating: PuzzleToCoCanDa/DaughtersCrown  
  inflating: PuzzleToCoCanDa/GoodJobMajor  
  inflating: PuzzleToCoCanDa/Money.xlsx  
```
We can see that the ZIP file contains a file called `GoodJobMajor`.

If we use the `exiftool` utility on that file to check the metadata we can find the name of the malicious actor.
```
$ exiftool GoodJobMajor 
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.42
File Name                       : GoodJobMajor

## What is the location of the attacker in this Universe?
On opening the `Money.xlsx` file, we can see that there are two sheets: `Sheet1` and `Sheet3`.

Let's covert both the sheets to text files so that we can view the content better.

If we open the `Sheet3.txt` file we can see some text that appears to be encrypted.

The `==` at the end indicates that the encryption is Base64.

We can use Cyberchef to decrypt the text.

## What could be the probable C&C domain to control the attackerâ€™s autonomous bots?
The attacker's name is `Pestero Negeja` and the reply-to email is `negeja3921@pashter.com` so we can guess the C&C domain used by the attacker.
### Answer
```
pashter.com
```
