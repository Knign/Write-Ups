Let's click on the `Submit Feedback` button.

On the `Submit Feedback` page, we can open the developer tools and inspect the `Back` link.

We can see that it is an `<a>` tag with the `backLink` ID and `href="/"`. 

Right below it, we can see the script which is responsible for setting it's `href` attribute.

```js
$(function() {
    $('#backLink').attr("href", (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath'));
});
```

- `$(function() {...})`: This is a shorthand for `$(document).ready(function() {...})`, which ensures that the code inside the function is executed when the DOM is fully loaded.
- `$('#backLink')`: Selects the HTML element with the ID 'backLink'.
- `.attr("href", ...)`: Sets the 'href' attribute of the selected element.
- `(new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath')`: Retrieves the value of the 'returnPath' parameter from the URL using the `URLSearchParams` API.

Now that we know how the script works, we can set the `returnPath` parameter in the URI to the following:

```html
javascript:alert(document.cookie)
```

Now if we click on the `Back` link, the Javascript that has been inserted in the `href` attribute will be executed.

We have solved the lab.
