If we go to `Target > Site map`,we can see a request for `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php`. Let's forward that request to the `Repeater` and send it.

When the response is returned to us, we can search for the following string:

```
SECRET_KEY
```

As we can see, the secret is revealed by the server in the response.

We can now submit the secret key as the answer:

```

```
