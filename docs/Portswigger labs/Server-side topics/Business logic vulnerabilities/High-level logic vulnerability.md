Now we can add the "Lightweight l33t leather jacket" to our cart.

Since we are proxying the traffic through Burp Suite, we can go `Proxy > HTTP History` to view the request.

Let's forward this request to the `Repeater` for further modification.
Once in the `Repeater`, we can set the `quantity` parameter to the following:
```
-2
```

Let's go back to our cart in the browser.

![[42 1.png]]

We can see that the `quantity` has gone from 1 to -1 since we set the `quantity` parameter to -2. Also the price is now negative.

Now, set the `quantity` back to 1 and add another product ("The Trolley-ON") to the cart.

We can view this request in the `Proxy > HTTP History` tab.

![[7 48.png]]

Let's forward it to the `Repeater`.
Inside the `Repeater` set the `quantity` parameter to the following and send the request:

```
-22
```

![[8 44.png]]

Let's check out our cart.

![[9 35.png]]

We can see that the quantity of "The Trolley-ON" has gone from 1 to -21.
More importantly the price which in in negative has been subtracted from the jacket's price and the total is now lower than our credits.
Let's buy the products.
