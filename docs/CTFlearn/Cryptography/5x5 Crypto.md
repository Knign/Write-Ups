> Ever heard of the 5x5 secret message system? If not, basically it's a 5x5 grid with all letters of the alphabet in order, without k because c is represented to make the k sound only. Google it if you need to. A letter is identified by Row-Column. All values are in caps. Try: 1-3,4-4,2-1,{,4-4,2-3,4-5,3-2,1-2,4-3,_,4-5,3-5,}
- The 5x5 cipher is also known as the Polybius cipher.

- We can substitute the numbers using the grid.
```
1-3 4-4 2-1 { 4-4 2-3 4-5 3-2 1-2 4-3 _ 4-5 3-5 }
 C   T   F  {  T   H   U   M   B   S  _  U   P  }
