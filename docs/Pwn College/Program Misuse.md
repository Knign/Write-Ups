IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level1) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/cat!
```

Let's just `cat` the flag.

```
hacker@program-misuse~level10:/$ /challenge/babysuid_level10 
Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level10!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
require you to understand their output to derive the flag from it.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/rev.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level10) every time that you restart

The `tar` utility is an archiving program designed to store multiple files in a single file (an archive), and to manipulate such archives.

```
hacker@program-misuse~level20:/$ tar -cvf flag.tar /flag && cat flag.tar

Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level39) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/cp!
```

The `cp` utility copies a file to the specified destination.

We know that the `/home/hacker` directory is a persistent one, i.e. every file in this directory is unmodified through all the levels. Knowing this, we can copy the `/flag` to this directory.

```
hacker@program-misuse~level39:~$ cp /flag flag.copy
```

Now, we can load level 1, and just `cat` the `flag.copy` file.
