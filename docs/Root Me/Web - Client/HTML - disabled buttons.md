The input field and the submit button are both disabled.

Let's go to `More tools > Developer tools > Elements` to check the code.

We can see that both the `<input>` elements have the `disabled` attribute. It is a boolean attribute which when present makes the input element unusable and un-clickable.

Let's remove the attribute and try again.
