> ### Objective
> Your goal is to get the administratorâ€™s password by brute forcing. Bonus points for getting the other four user passwords!

## Security Level: Low

- The application provides us with two input fields in order to enter the username and the password.
- Let's enter `admin` as both.

- Let's intercept the request in Burpsuite.

- We can now forward this request to the `Intruder` to automate the attack.

- After adding a field to the password, we can move on to setting up the substitution payload.

- For the payload type we want a simple list, more specifically the `darkweb2017-top100.txt` passwords lists from the `seclists` collection.
- Before we start the attack there is something important that we have to do.
- In the `Options` tab, we can set the string to grep for.
- We can set it to the following:
```
Username and/or password incorrect.
```

- Let's start the attack.

- We can immediately see that the response for `password` did not include the string.
- Let's take a closer look at the response.

- We can see that it greets us with a welcome message. This means that the password is `password`.
