- The text is encoded in LeetSpeak.
- In order to decode we just have to substitute the numbers with the equivalent characters.

| Character | Number |
| --------- | ------ |
| a         | 4      |
| o         | 0      |
| t         | 7      |
| r         | 2      |
| e         | 3      |
| g         | 9      |

base32 is super common in CTF's
```

## Question
> RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==
- Similar to the previous one, the `==` is a sign of Base64 encoding.
- Let's decode it using the `base64` command.
```
$ echo "RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==" | base64 -d
Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.  
```
## Answer
