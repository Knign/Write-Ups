## Task 1: Translation & Shifting
### c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?
- The text is encoded in LeetSpeak.
- In order to decode we just have to substitute the numbers with the equivalent characters.

| Character | Number |
| --------- | ------ |
| a         | 4      |
| o         | 0      |
| t         | 7      |
| r         | 2      |
| e         | 3      |
| g         | 9      |

- We have to convert the bits into ASCII.
- We can do that using CyberChef.

### Answer
```
lets try some binary out!
```

&nbsp;

### MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======
- The `======` at the end is an indication of Base32 encoding.

![2](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/45c51c52-8c06-414d-9296-cebdf2349c64)

### Answer
```
base32 is super common in CTF's
```

&nbsp;

### RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==
- Similar to the previous one, the `==` is a sign of Base64 encoding.
- Let's decode it using the `base64` command.
```
$ echo "RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==" | base64 -d
Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.  
```
### Answer
```
Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.
```

### Answer
```
Rotate me 13 places!
```

&nbsp;

### *@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX
- Because all the characters are capitalized, we can tell that this is Rot47 encoding.

![5](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/74f10175-cd9f-4ccf-a450-be013d8d51ce)

```

&nbsp;

### 85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68
- Because this one does not have any characters, we can safely say that it is not Hexadecimal.
- Therefore it has to be Decimal.

### Answer
```
Let's make this a bit trickier...
```

&nbsp;

## Task 2: Spectrograms
### Download the file
- For this one we have to use a Spectrum analyzer tool Audacity, etc.
### Answer
```
Super Secret Message
```

&nbsp;

## Task 3: Steganography
### Decode the image to reveal the answer.
- Steganography is the method of hiding data or even other files in an image files.
- There are other types of steganography as well such as video steganography, sudio steganography, etc.
- We can extract the hidden file using `steghide`.
```
$ steghide extract -sf stegosteg.jpg  
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "steganopayload2248.txt".
```
- Let's read the flag.
```
$ cat steganopayload2248.txt 
SpaghettiSteg 
```
### Answer
```
SpaghettiSteg
```

&nbsp;

## Task 4: Task 4 Security through obscurity
### Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?
- We can extract the files inside the image using `binwalk`.
```
$ binwalk -e meme.jpg

- Let's list the contents of the `_meme.jpg.extracted` directory that was created.
```
$ ls _meme.jpg.extracted 
122A7.rar  12385  12385.zlib  hackerchat.png
```
### Answer
```
hackerchat.png
```

### Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.
- If we just run `strings` on the `hackerchat.png` file, we will see the flag at the very bottom.
```
$ strings hackerchat

"AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!"
