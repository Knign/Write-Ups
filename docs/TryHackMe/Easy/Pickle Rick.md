## Task 1: Pickle Rick
### What is the first ingredient that Rick needs?
Let's perform a simple `nmap` scan to see which ports are open.
```
$ nmap -sC -sV 10.10.88.164
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-11 14:52 IST

```
There are two open ports:

| Port | Service |
| :-: | :-: |
| 22   | ssh     |
| 80   | http    |

Let's enter the IP address in the browser and see what comes up.

Let's check the page source for more information.

![3](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/be514f8f-df42-42f2-b747-5bb8b4a343cf)

So we have a username now: `R1ckRul3s`. However we don't know the password yet.

On most websites, the `robots.txt` file does the job of disallowing web crawlers from accessing particular pages. Let's see if we can find anything there.

Looks like `Wubbalubbadubdub` is the password.

But where should we enter these credentials?
In order to find the login page we will have to perform some directory brute-forcing. There are various tools available, but in this case let's use `gobuster`.
```
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.88.164 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php

```
We can see a `/login.php` file. Let's go to the file in the browser.

![5](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/b7853f1d-fbc0-4ecb-ad1c-d2bff3fb09e3)

Let's enter the credentials that we found before i.e. `R1ckRul3s` as username and `Wubbalubbadubdub` as the password.

![6](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/47807896-3cb1-4374-922a-b55e7bb4378e)

We're in and we have a `Command Panel` to enter our commands.

We can use the `ls` command to list the files and subdirectories.

![7](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/4e153ed7-49bd-498c-91d0-8ea6cd04720f)

The `Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt` file seems interesting. Let's `cat` the contents of that file.

![8](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/3fa9ddc0-5d16-489c-a440-726ff8a027b9)

Oh! So `cat` is disabled. We have to find another way to read the file.

We can `grep` all the contents of the file by using the `.` regular expression.
```
grep . Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
```

### What is the second ingredient in Rickâ€™s potion?
We can check which user are present by using the following command:
```
cd /home ; ls
```

![10](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/082c2c36-7474-427b-8af6-4b067f56973f)

Let's check what files `rick` has using the following command:
```
cd /home/rick ; ls
```

![11](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/5f9aae7a-1551-49d2-8e58-b52001af6882)

Let's see what is in to the `second ingredients`.
```
grep . /home/rick/"second ingredients"
```

### What is the last and final ingredient?
Let's look at the `/root` directory using the following command:
```
sudo ls /root
```

![13](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/f0ca0ca7-10cb-4d6e-b473-825d342c0e58)

As always, we can use `grep` to read the contents of a file.
```
sudo grep . /root/3rd.txt
```
